# Overview of the project

The project is composed of two steps:

- Step 1: Taxonomic profiling, the process of identifying which species are present and their relative abundance. The input are metagenomic samples (reads) from the biosample, in the form of fastq files. What you get at the end is a taxonomic profile, describing the bacterial composition of the sample.
- Step 2: Comparative metagenomic analysis. Here we will evaluate which species are correlated to helthy or diseased patients. In this example we will focus on colorectal cancer patients.
