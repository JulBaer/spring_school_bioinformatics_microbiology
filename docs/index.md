# Overview
This Spring School is co-organized by the [NCCR AntiResist](https://www.nccr-antiresist.ch/en/), [NCCR Microbiomes](https://nccr-microbiomes.ch/) and the [SIB PhD Training Network](https://www.sib.swiss/training/who-can-benefit#for-phd-students).
The goal of this joint School is to provide PhD students and postdocs with theoretical and mostly hands-on knowledge on selected topics about microbiome and antibiotics resistance. In particular, the participants will be split into four groups to work on mini-projects, which will address the following topics:

* Project 1: Modeling antibiotic resistance evolution.
* Project 2: Computational image analysis: transforming images into insights.
* Project 3: Profiling and modeling the colorectal cancer microbiome.
* Project 4: Mathematical modeling of bacterial metabolism.


# Audience
This course is addressed to life scientists (mostly PhD students and Postdocs) dealing with microbiology topics such as microbiomes and resistance to antibiotics.

# Learning outcomes
At the end of the course, the participants are expected to:

* have a good understanding of the most common methods used during the event;
* repeat the same type of analysis achieved during the mini-project;
* present the mini-project and more globally disseminate their experience to the members of their group.
