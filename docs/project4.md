* *Description:* We will step-by-step build simple ODE models of a metabolic network integrating regulation on both the metabolic and gene expression level, and investigate the effect of these layers of regulation on the network dynamics. The course will be structured around two examples: (i) carbon catabolite repression and diauxic growth in bacteria and (ii) synthrophic interactions in a consortium of two bacterial strains. All simulations will be carried out by means of Python.
